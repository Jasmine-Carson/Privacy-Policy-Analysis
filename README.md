# Privacy-Policy-Analysis
Code from research experience at CSU, machine learning NLP.

This is the final code and data used for our research on automated privacy policy text classification. The main data is the OPP-115 Corpus from https://www.usableprivacy.org/data, and a second, much smaller, dataset was compiled by us from privacy policies of IoT devices.

We achieved 81% accuracy using tf-idf vectorization and logistic regression for classification, and the same result with tf-idf and support vector machines, on the OPP-115 data. With the SpaCy neural network's bag-of-words method, we achieved 84% accuracy.

Code produced by Jasmine Carson and Lisa DiSalvo, under the direction of Dr. Lydia Ray.
